<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<p>
    This project is meant to help users calculate what they need to lift for different weight cycles that are based
    off of percentages of their one rep max for different lifts. It calculates the correct weight needs for different
    sets and also gives them an overview of what the cycle looks like. The program also show the correct loading of the barbell
    so there is no second guessing at the gym.

<h5>
    About the Hatch Cycle
</h5>
<p>
    For the Hatch Cycle you are lifting varying rep schemes based on different percentages of your one rep max for
    both the front and the back squat. For example, on day one the sets is 1X10 at 60%. If your one rep max is 200lbs
    for the back squat, 60% of that would be 120 and you would lift that 10 times.
