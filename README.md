<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<p>
    This project is a continuation of my previous weight lifting program. I have added a graph feature for users. The system
    auto populates the graph with the users entered maxes and create a graph showing their 1rep, 3rep, 5rep and 10rep max potentials
    based on the entered information. The user can then use this to calculate out a 10rep max (or 3 or 5) potential based on a 1rep max or
    vise versa, all depending on their input choice.
